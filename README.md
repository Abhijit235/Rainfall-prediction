Rainfall Prediction Using XGBoost üåßÔ∏è
Welcome to the Rainfall Prediction App! This project uses machine learning with XGBoost to predict whether it will rain tomorrow, based on historical weather data collected from various Australian locations. The goal of this project is to provide accurate rainfall forecasts using meteorological data.

Project Overview:

Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for sectors like agriculture, water management, and disaster preparedness. In this project, I developed a predictive model using the XGBoost algorithm trained on weather data from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).

The features include key meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and more, making the prediction both reliable and insightful.

Features of the App
User-Friendly Interface:

Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
Enter weather conditions, and the app instantly predicts if it will rain tomorrow.
XGBoost Model:

Trained with carefully preprocessed weather data.
Provides high accuracy in rainfall prediction.
Responsive Design:

The app works on both desktop and mobile devices.
Technologies Used
Python
XGBoost for machine learning
Streamlit for app deployment
Pandas for data preprocessing
GitHub for version control and project management
